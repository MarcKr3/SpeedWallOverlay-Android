    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">SpeedWall Overlay &mdash; Effective date: January 30, 2026</p>

    <p>SpeedWall Overlay ("the App") is a climbing wall measurement and overlay tool developed by mV. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No account or registration is required.</li>
        <li>No personal information is collected.</li>
        <li>No usage data or analytics are gathered.</li>
        <li>No data is sent to any server or third party.</li>
        <li>The App does not use advertising or ad tracking.</li>
        <li>The App does not access the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The App requires access to your device's camera for its core functionality: displaying a real-time overlay on a climbing wall for measurement and calibration purposes. Camera frames are processed entirely on your device and are never stored, uploaded, or shared. The camera feed exists only in memory while the App is active.</p>

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>
    <p>When you choose to take a screenshot using the in-app button, the image is saved locally to your device's photo gallery. These files remain entirely on your device and are never transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>Sensors</h2>
    <p>The App may access your device's accelerometer sensor for the auto-level feature. This sensor data is used in real time on the device only and is not recorded or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate any third-party services, SDKs, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
